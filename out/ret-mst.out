Dear all,

The marks for the MST have been released. They are available under the [M=
ST Assignment] (https://canvas.lms.unimelb.edu.au/courses/182742/assignme=
nts/474868). The marks for each question are detailed in a comment in the=
 assignment.

Please note that question 15 refers to the overflow answer box. It is jus=
t a placeholder and has no marks allocated to it. If you used the overflo=
w box, the marks for your answers are reflected in the corresponding ques=
tion (not the overflow box).

Below are some important details on sample solutions, remark requests, an=
d viewing sessions.

MST Consultation Hour
---------------------

I will hold a Zoom consultation hour on Friday 26/04, 12:00pm -1:00pm. Du=
ring the session, I will present sample solutions for each of the questio=
ns and a high-level overview of the marking criteria.

I anticipate this session to be helpful in the following ways:

* Help you review the concepts covered in the MST

* Allow you to understand the marks you received for the short-answer que=
stions

* Provide some useful strategies when approaching questions in an exam se=
tting

* Help you prepare for the final exam

Meeting details

* Zoom link: [https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/83679607466?pwd=3DNDhNaTMxSEU5WkE=
xUlV2RzYybTZoZz09&from=3Daddon] (https://unimelb.zoom.us/j/83679607466?pw=
d=3DNDhNaTMxSEU5WkExUlV2RzYybTZoZz09&from=3Daddon)

* For those of you who cannot attend, the meeting will be recorded and po=
sted on Canvas

Requests to Remark
------------------

If, after attending (or watching the recording of) the MST consultation s=
ession, you believe a mistake was made in marking your test, you can subm=
it a request to remark.

A form to request remarks will be available in the MST module after the M=
ST consultation hour.

Once you submit the request, all the short-answer questions in the MST wi=
ll be remarked by a different examiner. Please note that this might resul=
t in a final MST mark that is higher or lower than the original one. The =
new mark will be final.

The deadline to submit a remark request is Friday 03/05 at 11:59pm. =C2=A0=


Viewing Sessions
----------------

If you would like to view your test and review your own answers, then you=
 can register for ([registration form] (https://forms.office.com/r/EuWKWC=
aQDa)) and attend one of the following MST viewing sessions:

Session 1

Session 2

You can attend the session you have registered for at any time between th=
e stipulated time frame. Please note that we require you to register so t=
hat we can have your test available during the session.

Marks will NOT be reviewed during these sessions. The viewing sessions ar=
e solely intended for you to review your own answers. For solutions and a=
n overview of the marking criteria, please attend the MST consultation se=
ssion. If you think an error has been made while marking your test, pleas=
e submit a request remark form.

All the best,

Maria
